Title: 
Class Survey Analysis

Description_Project: 
Clean and analyze a survey conducted among the Fall 2024 Advanced Data Analysis Class members at the Brown School of Public Health.

Decription_Code: 
To run the analysis and reproduce the results, you'll need the following software and packages: 
	R (4.4.1 or higher)
	RStudio (2024.04.2-764 or higher) or any other IDE supporting R Markdown
	'haven'
	'readr'
	'dplyr'
Load necessary packages using the library function and 'pacman::p_load()' to enable file processing
Import the dataset from the Github site (https://github.com/kijohnson/ADA-2024) and call the data frame using the 'read_csv()' function
Use the 'dim()' function to show the dimensions of the data frame 
Change the names of the columns by using the 'names()' function then show the names using the 'colnames() function'
Determine the class that the variables belong to by using the 'sapply()' function - the first argument is the dataset, and the second argument is the request type
Count the number of observations in each class type using the 'table()' function
To summarize or highlight the elements of a variable, use the 'summary()' function and add the '$' sign at the end of the dataset followed by the variable name.
Check for unique values in the dataset using the 'unique()' function
Force/coerce non-numeric entries in an otherwise or intended numeric variable to 'NA' (not applicable) using the 'as.numeric()' function. Then show the structure of your dataframe using the 'str()' function
'useNA ="ifany"' shows the instances where non-meric entries were made in the variable
Use the pipe function '%>%' to move the output of one function into another
The 'mutate()' function creates a new variable; include the 'case_when' function to the syntax to specify instances
To generate the margin sums, use the 'addmargins()' function
