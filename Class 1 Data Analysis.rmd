#1. Import class one survey data from our Github site (https://github.com/kijohnson/ADA-2024) (The dataset is called ‘Class 1 Survey Fall 2024_di.csv’), calling the R dataframe that you create C1survey.

class_SA_csv <-
 read_csv(
   "https://github.com/kijohnson/ADA-2024/raw/main/Class%201%20(Getting%20started%20and%20RR%20I)/Lab/Class%201%20Survey%20Fall%202024_di.csv"
   )
```

```{r}
#2. Determine: a. the number of observations (i.e. the number of people who filled out the survey) and b. the number of variables in the dataframe.

dim(class_SA_csv)
#the dim function shows the dimensions of the dataframe i.e., observations(x) and variables (y)
```

```{r}
#3. a. Rename the column variables to something shorter and that is descriptive of what the variable is about (for example like_dogs for the ‘Do you like dogs?’ question variable) and b. Display that they are renamed.

names(class_SA_csv)[1:27] <- c("ID", "cats", "dogs", "item", "slogan", "day", "LOH", "food", "drink", "season", "month", "hobby", "degree", "specialization", "software", "Rx", "coding", "duration", "learn", "interest", "number", "bday", "bmonth", "country", "state", "city", "LOE")

colnames(class_SA_csv)

```{r}
#4. Write code to determine and display the number of factor, integer, numerical, and character variables there are in the C1survey dataset.

#First, determine the type of class each variable belongs to
x <- sapply(class_SA_csv, class)

#Then, count the number of observations in each class type
x_counts <- table(x)

#Lastly, display the counts
x_counts
```

```{r}
#5. a. Using code, check the bday and bmonth variables for any unusual or missing values. If you find any, b. describe what you will do with the unusual values in a comment before or immediately following the code that does it, and c. after you have cleaned up any unusual values, find the median bday and month. *Note: please make sure that your bday and month variables are numeric before doing statistics
```

```{r}
#a) Checking the bday and bmonth variables for any unusual or missing values

summary(class_SA_csv$bday) #summarizes the birthday column
summary(class_SA_csv$bmonth) #summarizes the birth month column
```

```{r}
#Checking for unique values since R classifies the observations in both variables as characters

unique(class_SA_csv$bday)
unique(class_SA_csv$bmonth)
```

```{r}
#b) Considering that there are a few string (character) observations in both variables, I will first attempt to eliminate these by converting them to NA through brute coercion to numeric variables.

class_SA_csv$bday <- as.numeric(class_SA_csv$bday)
class_SA_csv$bmonth <- as.numeric(class_SA_csv$bmonth)

# Quick check to verify that the variables are now structurally numeric
str(class_SA_csv$bday)
str(class_SA_csv$bmonth)
```

```{r}

#To see the frequency of the unusual or missing values
table(class_SA_csv$bday, useNA = "ifany")
table(class_SA_csv$bmonth, useNA = "ifany")
```

```{r}
# c) To determine the median of both variables, we use the median function alongside the remove function to eliminate the missing or unusual values.

median(class_SA_csv$bday, na.rm=TRUE)
median(class_SA_csv$bmonth, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#6. a) Create a new variable called bseason that gives the season according to Northern Meteorological season in which respondents were born (winter = 12/1 to 2/29, spring = 3/1 to 5/31, summer = 6/1 to 8/31, fall = 9/1 to 11/30). b. Using the table function, print a table of Seasons in the columns and bmonths in the rows that allows you to check that the coding is correct c. Sum the columns using the addmargins function to answer the question of how many classmates were born in each season? Include your answer in the code.

#a) Creating a new variable 'bseason' based on birth moth
class_SA_csv <- class_SA_csv %>%
 mutate(bseason = 
          case_when(bmonth %in% c(12, 1, 2) ~ "winter", #Months 12, 1, 2 -> Winter
                    bmonth %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "spring",  #Months 3, 4, 5 -> spring
                    bmonth %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "summer",  #Months 6, 7, 8 -> summer
                    bmonth %in% c(9, 10, 11) ~ "fall"   #Months 9, 10, 11 -> fall
                  ))

```

```{r}
#b) Creating a seasons table: seasons as columns and birth month as row

seasons_table <- table(class_SA_csv$bmonth, class_SA_csv$bseason, useNA = "ifany")
seasons_table
```

```{r}
#C) Summing the column using the addmargins function 

seasons_table_with_margins_sums <- addmargins(seasons_table)
seasons_table_with_margins_sums

#To determine the number of classmates born in each season,  first we get the counts
season_counts <- table(class_SA_csv$bseason, useNA = "ifany")

#then convert to a dataframe for easier manipulation
season_df <- as.data.frame(season_counts)

# To describe the number of people born in each season
season_descriptions <- paste(season_df$Var1, "has", season_df$Freq, "people born in this season.")


cat(season_descriptions, sep = "\n")
```

```{r}
#7. Pick your favorite variable or variables to analyze, come up with a question you want to answer with that variable or variables, generate the code, and provide an answer to your question. Describe what you did using comments (i.e. #’s).

#What is the commonest favorite number in the class?
#To answer this question, I will find the frequency of the objects in this variable.

table(class_SA_csv$number, useNA = "ifany")
```

```{r}
#The commonest favorite number in the class is 7. 
```
